# 📂 File Organizer in Node.js

## 📌 Description
I have created a **File Organizer** in Node.js.  
It is a small but useful project designed to automatically organize files into their respective folders based on file types.  

For handling files, the project uses:
- **File System (`fs`)** module → to read, create, and move files  
- **Path (`path`)** module → to handle and join file paths

## ⚡ Features
- Organizes files into categories like **Images, Music, Videos, Documents, Archives**  
- Creates category folders automatically if they don’t exist  
- Moves files to their respective folders (works like cut-paste)  
- Skips folders and files with unsupported extensions
